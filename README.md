#DESCRIPTION

(A Recommendation System predicts a user's preference for items (e.g., movies, products) based on past interactions. Two popular approaches include Collaborative Filtering and Matrix Factorization.
1. Collaborative Filtering (CF)
Collaborative Filtering relies on user behavior (ratings, purchases) rather than item content. It can be:User-Based CF: Recommends items that similar users liked.Item-Based CF: Recommends items similar to those the user already liked.
Steps to Implement:
Collect user-item interaction data (e.g., movie ratings).
Create a user-item matrix, where rows are users, columns are items, and values are ratings.
Calculate similarity (cosine or Pearson correlation) between users or items.
Predict ratings by averaging the ratings of similar users/items.
Recommend top-N items based on predicted scores.
2. Matrix Factorization (MF):Matrix Factorization decomposes the user-item interaction matrix into lower-dimensional matrices.
Python Libraries: surprise, scipy, numpy)
